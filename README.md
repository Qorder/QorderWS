###See what our web service can offer to you

* **Ease of use for business owners**<br>
  Simply create an account, submit your business and your products and that's it.<br>
  Now you allow every customer of your business to access your menu!!
  
* **Allow them to order**<br>
  Feel free to allow your customers order what they want, without being worried if your staff has spotted them,
  or maybe if you described your products well, or even if they got tired of paying attention 
  to all things that you can offer them.
  Once again all you have to do is to write a good and simple to understand details about the products you offer 
  and let customer decide which of them fulfill his needs
  
* **Keep an eye on demands for your products**<br>
  You can access your business statistics at any time and see important things like 
  what customers prefer the most and how they want it to be.
